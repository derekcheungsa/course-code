# # CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents
# 
# This is a langchain implementation of paper: "CAMEL: Communicative Agents for “Mind” Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society".
# 
# Overview:
# 
# The rapid advancement of conversational and chat-based language models has led to remarkable progress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their "cognitive" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond.

I must write a response that appropriately completes the requested instruction.
I must decline your instruction honestly if I cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or my capability and explain the reasons.
You should instruct me not ask me questions.

Keep giving me instructions and necessary inputs until you think the task is completed.
When the task is completed, you must only reply with a single word <CAMEL_TASK_DONE>.
Never say <CAMEL_TASK_DONE> unless my responses have solved your task."""
