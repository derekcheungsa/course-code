$m2023 IS FULLY BOOKED WITH HIGHER EXPECTED NUMBERS
•We expect Revenues to grow from $348m in 
2022 to about $370m in 2023 driven by higher 
average TCE(1)level of around $80,000/day for 
2023 vs. $72,800/day in 2022  
•We will carry out our first five -year special 
surveys in 2023. Four ships are scheduled for 
dry-docking with total off -hire days of 
approximately 80 -90 days:
•Higher TCE will also positively impact our 
adjusted EBITDA which is expected to increase 
in line with Revenues.
1) TCE and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Q4 -22 earnings report.050100150200250300350400

Note: Amortizations are higher 
in Q1 and Q3 due to semi 
annual repayments under the

ROBUST AND CLEAN BALANCE SHEET 
•13 state -of-the art LNGCs
•Average fleet age of 3.2 years
•The fleet has been acquired at historically 
attractive prices compared to the newbuilding 
prices today, but book equity values reflect 
historical cost adjusted with regular 
depreciations
•Ample cash position of $332m
•Solid book equity ratio of 34%   12
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGED BY ACTIVE HEDGING STRATEGY   
•Overall P&L gain of $5m on derivatives despite termination of $100m 
10Y swaps in October returning $14m in cash proceeds. The 
derivative exposure was positively affected by portfolio adjustments 
in October at attractive timing where duration was shortened by the 
above termination and an amendment of $100m 10Y where $15.5m 
of gains where used for a new $181m 2.5Y swap at 0.9%.
•Added $50m 10Y swap at 3.26% in January at attractive timing. 
•Hedge ratio on net outstanding debt is positively affected by strong 
cash position and higher RCF capacity.

BALANCE SHEET OPTIMIZATION FINALIZED
1) Age adjusted repayment profile .       2) Proceeds expected netofi) outstanding debt and ii) fees .       3) ~50% of lease fixed at all -in rate of 3.5% and remaining part of lease floating at SOFR + margin of 1.55%

Just like in 2019, eight of the top 10 LNG import 
growth markets were European. In 2019 
European market acted as a demand sink 
doubling its LNG imports due to lower global 
economic growth and the US -China Trade War 
which suspended Chinese LNG imports from US
