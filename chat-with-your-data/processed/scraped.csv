(“Flex LNG” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Highlights: Vessel operating revenue of $74.6 million for the first quarter 2022, compared to $114.6 million for the fourth quarter 2021. Net income of $55.8 million and basic earnings per share of $1.05 for the first quarter 2022, compared to net income of $69.4 million and basic earnings per share of $1.31 for the fourth quarter 2021. Average Time Charter Equivalent1 (“TCE”) rate of $62,627 per day for the first quarter 2022, compared to $95,908 per day for the fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA1 of $56.3 million for the first quarter 2022, compared to $95.5 million for the fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted net income1 of $23.8 million for the first quarter 2022, compared to $62.8 million for the fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1 of $0.45 for the first quarter 2022, compared to $1.18 for the fourth quarter 2021. In March 2022, the Company signed a $375 million term and revolving credit facility, with an accordion option to increase this by $125 million, secured against an additional vessel. The facility will be secured by the vessels Flex Ranger, Flex Rainbow and Flex Endeavour, while Flex Enterprise is a candidate for the accordion option. In April 2022, the Flex Ranger and Flex Rainbow completed their re-financing with net cash provided to the Company of $11.5 million. In April 2022, the Company signed an aggregate $320 million sale and leaseback agreements for the refinancing of the existing facility for the vessels Flex Constellation and Flex Courageous. Completion of the refinancing is expected in May 2022, subject to customary closing conditions in connection with delivery and acceptance of each vessel. The financing is expected to release approximately $99.6 million to the Company. In April 2022, Flex Volunteer commenced its time charter agreement as the fourth vessel with Cheniere, as part of the agreements signed in April 2021. The vessel was delivered approximately two months prior to the agreed delivery schedule. The fixed rate time charter has a firm period ending in the first quarter 2026. In April 2022, Cheniere declared their option for a fifth time charter agreement for the vessel, Flex Aurora. The fixed rate time charter will commence in the third quarter 2022 with a firm period ending in the first quarter 2026. The Company declared a dividend for the first quarter 2022 of $0.75 per share. Øystein M Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented:“The first quarter was a fantastic period to be a cargo owner with high demand and elevated prices for LNG given the global energy crunch. For the spot freight market, the first quarter was however challenging as the LNG trade abruptly shifted towards Europe resulting in lower sailing distances and thus higher availability of ships depressing freight economics as liquidity in the spot market also dried up. The sentiment in the freight market did however turn positive during the end of February and spot rates for modern tonnage have now recovered to above seasonal average while the one-year and three-year Time Charter rates for remains very strong. This is evidencing that charterers are willing to pay a substantial premium to spot rates in order to lock in large fuel-efficient ships on longer periods as the forward market also price in a much tighter freight market in the second half of the year. During the last 13 months we have successfully secured in total nine fixed hire Time Charters with first class counterparties. The minimum period of these contracts ranges from three to five years which gives us comfortable earnings visibility. We still have three ships which will be redelivered from existing Time Charterers during the next 23 months and given the strong term market and general lack of available modern tonnage we are upbeat about the prospects of re-contracting these ships at attractive terms. Revenue wise, we are pleased to deliver revenues for the quarter of $74.6 million in line with our revenue guidance communicated in February. With 98 per cent contract coverage for the year and three of our 13 ships on variable hire contracts linked to the spot market, we do expect gradual increased revenues in the next three quarters as we also guided in February. Given the strong backlog, positive outlook and our very solid financial position, the Board is therefore again declaring a dividend for the quarter of 75 cents per share. This provides our shareholders with an annualized yield of around 12 per cent which should be attractive given the wobbly financial markets these days.” First Quarter 2022 Result PresentationIn connection with the earnings release, a webcast and conference call will be held today at 15:00 CEST (9:00 a.m. EST).

(“Flex LNG” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Highlights: * Vessel operating revenues of $97.9 million for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $91.3 million for the third quarter 2022. * Net income of $41.4 million and basic earnings per share of $0.78 for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to net income of $46.6 million and basic earnings per share of $0.88 for the third quarter 2022. * Average Time Charter Equivalent1 (“TCE”) rate of $81,699 per day for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $75,941 per day for the third quarter 2022. * Adjusted EBITDA1 of $79.1 million for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $70.9 million for the third quarter 2022. * Adjusted net income1 of $54.5 million for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $42.2 million for the third quarter 2022. * Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1 of $1.02 for the fourth quarter 2022, compared to $0.79 for the third quarter 2022. * In December 2022, the Company has issued 409,741 ordinary shares under the ATM program, for aggregate gross proceeds of $14.8 million or $36.09 per share with aggregate net proceeds of $14.5 million. * In January 2023, the Company signed 12-year sale and leaseback agreements for Flex Amber and Flex Artemis of $170 million and $160 million respectively, with a margin of 215 basis points per annum. * In February 2023, the Company signed term sheets for a $180 million 10-year sale and leaseback with an Asian-based lease provider agreement for Flex Rainbow. * In February 2023, the Company received credit approved term sheets for a $290 million term and revolving credit facility with a margin of 1.85%, a 6 year tenor and a 22 year age-adjusted repayment profile. * As per date of this report, the Company has SOFR and LIBOR based interest rate swaps with aggregate notional principals of $481 million and $260 million respectively. The weighted average SOFR interest rate is 1.72% with weighted average duration of 6.7 years. Whilst the weighted average LIBOR interest rate is 1.11% with a weighted average duration of 2.3 years. * The Company declared a dividend for the fourth quarter 2022 of $1.00 per share, consisting of a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 per share. Øystein M Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented: “We today release the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results for Flex LNG, and we are pleased to report that our Revenues came in at $98 million which was in line with guidance of $95-98 million. Net income was a solid $41 million with an even healthier adjusted net income of $55 million, reflecting the fact that we realized profits on part of our interest rate derivative portfolio prior to long term rates slumping due to lower US inflation numbers. This resulted in earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share of $0.78 and $1.02 respectively. During the quarter we continued building attractive charter backlog with minimum 14 years added through an agreement with Cheniere to extend three ships which they already had on Time Charter from us. This agreement added additional earnings visibility to our company. Altogether, we added a total of minimum 38 years of backlog during 2022 through extension of Time Charters with existing customers and our first two fully open positions are now in 2027 which coincide nicely with the next wave of LNG volumes coming to the market in that period. We are therefore upbeat about the prospects for adding additional long term charter backlog for those two ships in due course. We today also announce that our extensive balance sheet optimization program, which we initiated in November 2021, is now finalized with refinancing secured for the last three ships. As we have added significant charter backlog through 2021 and 2022, we have been able to utilize our de-risked chartering profile to replace all our existing debt with new debt financing with improved terms and conditions. In total, we have secured more than $2bn of new financing during this period and once all the debt is drawn and executed, we expect to release in total $387m in net cash proceeds from this process. This will add further liquidity to our already substantial cash balance. So, with the recent addition of charter backlog coupled with the refinancing process we will have a river of cashflow into a vast pool of liquidity which provides us with ample room to continue paying attractive regular dividends to our shareholders. Given our strong financial position, the Board has therefore decided to pay a special dividend of $0.25 per share in addition to the quarterly dividend of $0.75, bringing the dividend to $1.00 per share for the fourth quarter and in total $3.75 per share declared for 2022. This provides our investors with a solid income stream yielding about 11 per cent. Going forward we do expect our financial performance to further improve as we are fully booked for 2023. We expect revenues to grow from $348 million in 2022 to around $370 million for 2023, driven by higher Time Charter Equivalent Earnings which we expect to be around $80,000 per day in 2023, an improvement from the $72,800 per day delivered in 2022. Revenues are expected to increase despite us carrying out our first five-year special surveys for four ships with associated off-hire during 2023. Lastly, I would like to extend my gratitude to all personnel both at sea and shore which have contributed to the results presented today.” Fourth Quarter 2022 Result Presentation In connection with the earnings release, a live video webcast will be held at 3:00 p.m. CET (9:00 a.m. EST).

(“Flex LNG” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Highlights: Vessel operating revenues of $84.2 million for the second quarter 2022, compared to $74.6 million for the first quarter 2022. Net income of $44.3 million and basic earnings per share of $0.83 for the second quarter 2022, compared to net income of $55.8 million and basic earnings per share of $1.05 for the first quarter 2022. Average Time Charter Equivalent1 (“TCE”) rate of $70,707 per day for the second quarter 2022, compared to $62,627 per day for the first quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA1 of $66.1 million for the second quarter 2022, compared to $56.3 million for the first quarter 2022. Adjusted net income1 of $32.5 million for the second quarter 2022, compared to $23.8 million for the first quarter 2022. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1 of $0.61 for the second quarter 2022, compared to $0.45 for the first quarter 2022. In June 2022, the Company replaced the existing variable rate time charters with new seven year time charters for the Flex Enterprise and Flex Amber which commenced in the third quarter 2022. In June 2022, the Company signed a 10 year fixed rate time charter for Flex Rainbow commencing in the first quarter 2023. In August 2022, the Company successfully executed a call option for $137 million to buy back the Flex Enterprise under its sale and leaseback agreement. As a result, the vessel is currently unencumbered. In August 2022, the Company declared a call option to repurchase the Flex Endeavour, which will be re-financed under the $375 Million Facility in September 2022. The Company now has SOFR and LIBOR based interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principals of $450 million and $403.4 million respectively. The weighted average SOFR interest rate is 1.90% with weighted average duration of 9 years. Whilst the weighted average LIBOR interest rate is 1.04% with a weighted average duration of 2.8 years. The Company declared a dividend for the second quarter 2022 of $1.25 per share, consisting of a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share and a special, one-time dividend of $0.50 per share. Øystein M Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented:“We in Flex LNG are today pleased to release solid second quarter results. We are in the midst of a global gas crunch where buyers, especially in Europe, are scrambling to get their hands on LNG cargoes to ensure adequate energy supplies ahead of the winter. Hence, we are seeing increased interest for LNG with several new export projects now being pushed forward. New LNG export projects will create future freight demand, further underpinning the very sound long-term fundamentals of our industry. In the second quarter we delivered revenues of $84.2 million. This is about $10 million higher than in the first quarter, and in line with our previous revenue guidance. Net income for the quarter came in at a healthy $44.3 million or 83 cents per share. Unlike the Federal Reserve, we have been ahead of the curve, hedging a substantial part of our interest rate exposure prior to inflation concerns surfacing. We are therefore booking further gains on our interest rate hedges. In the second quarter the gains were $14.5 million, and this comes on top of the $31.9 million we booked in the first quarter. Adjusting for the non-cash portion of the hedging gains, our adjusted net income came in at $32.5 million or 61 cents per share. We recently announced three attractive new long-term contracts. Two seven-year charters for Flex Enterprise and Flex Amber commenced on July 1st while Flex Rainbow will commence a ten-year contract early next year. In total, these three contracts have added 24 years of backlog which is expected to generate approximately $750 million of revenues in total. Consequently, our backlog has increased to minimum 54 years, and this provides a very high level of earnings visibility going forward. We are therefore reiterating our revenue guidance of about $90 million for the third quarter and somewhere between $90 and $100 million for the fourth quarter. Hence, we expect even stronger results in the second half of the year as we are re-pricing our portfolio of ships with longer duration contracts. We recently finalized the first phase of our balance sheet optimization program in which we raised $137 million of additional cash while also improving financing terms. We have now initiated the second phase of this balance sheet optimization program with the aim of raising an additional $100m of fresh cash while simultaneously improving financing terms. With a super strong cash balance at quarter end of $283.7 million we have therefore decided to distribute some of our surplus cash back to our shareholders. On the back of this, we are once again declaring an ordinary quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share. Further, we are also pleased to reward our shareholders with a special dividend of 50 cents per share, bringing the total dividend in the second quarter to $1.25 per share. With this special dividend, the dividend for the last four quarters adds up to $3.5 per share annually which provides our shareholders with an attractive yield of around 10 per cent.” Second Quarter 2022 Result PresentationFlex LNG will release its financial results for the second quarter 2022 on Wednesday August 24, 2022.

The weighted average SOFR interest rate is 1.32% with weighted average duration of 5.3 years. Whilst the weighted average LIBOR interest rate is 1.11% with a weighted average duration of 2.6 years.• The Company declared a dividend for the third quarter 2022 of $0.75 per share. Øystein M Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented:“During the third quarter, Flex Enterprise and Flex Amber commenced their new seven-year Time Charters agreed in June 2022. Additionally, Flex Aurora was delivered to Cheniere as the fifth and last ship under the agreement announced in April 2021. Hence, Flex LNG today have 12 LNG carriers on fixed hire Time Charters and one ship, Flex Artemis, on a variable time charter. Our first fully open ship, after charterer’s options, is in the middle of 2026 with three other ships coming open in 2027. Today, with 2027 the earliest newbuilding delivery window and newbuilding prices at around $250 million, we are therefore upbeat about the prospects of re-contracting our ships at attractive levels thereby adding further backlog to the Company. For the third quarter, Revenues came in at $91 million in line with previous guidance of approximately $90 million. Net income came in at a healthy $47 million equivalent to $0.88 per share. For the first nine months of 2022, total Net income is $147 million, fuelled by $75 million gains on interest rate derivatives, as we have been ahead of the curve locking in long term interest rates at very attractive levels before Federal Reserve started to hike rates. Adjusted Net income, whereby unrealized gains on derivatives and non-recurring items are eliminated came in at $42 million equivalent to $0.79 per share for the quarter. Following the completion of Balance Sheet Optimization Phase 1 in July where we raised $137 million of fresh cash by refinancing six of our ships, we announced Phase 2 of our Balance Sheet Optimization Program. Under Phase 2 we will optimize financing for the remaining seven ships in the fleet with the aim of increasing our cash position by a further $100m while at the same time improving our overall financing terms. We have now secured refinancing for four of the seven ships with net proceeds of $110 million. We are thus already ahead of the $100 million target, and we expect the cash release to grow further as we are also making good progress on the refinancing of the remaining three ships. In total, we now expect that the Balance Sheet Optimization Program will at least release $300 million in cash. Our cash position is already at a healthy $271 million at quarter end thus we expect this number to move upward as we are completing these refinancings. Given the strong freight market, our extensive contract backlog and our super strong financial position we are therefore today pleased to declare an ordinary quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share which should provide our shareholders with an attractive yield of approximately 10 per cent.” Third Quarter 2022 Result PresentationFlex LNG will release its financial results for the third quarter 2022 on Tuesday November 15, 2022.

Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “expect,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “pending,” “target,” “project,” “likely,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company’s records and other data available from third parties. Although management believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company’s control, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. As such, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of the Company’s future performance, and actual results and future developments may vary materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines any obligation, except as required by applicable law or regulation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of these factors. Further, the Company cannot assess the effect of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in any forward-looking statement. In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in the Company’s view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include: unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the LNG tanker market, the impact of public health threats and outbreaks of other highly communicable diseases, including the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on the LNG tanker market, changes in the Company’s operating expenses, including bunker prices, dry-docking and insurance costs, the fuel efficiency of the Company’s vessels, the market for the Company’s vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, ability to comply with covenants in such financing arrangements, failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with the Company, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, including those that may limit the commercial useful lives of LNG tankers, customers’ increasing emphasis on environmental and safety concerns, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions or events, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine, business disruptions, including supply chain disruption and congestion, due to natural or other disasters or otherwise, potential physical disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, climate-related incidents, or political events, vessel breakdowns and instances of off-hire, and other factors, including those that may be described from time to time in the reports and other documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“Other Reports”).
