Only gradually did I\nbecome aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his\ndrive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering\nif he were sick I went over to find out\u2014an unfamiliar butler with a\nvillainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n\n\u201cIs Mr. Gatsby sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d After a pause he added \u201csir\u201d in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.\nCarraway came over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d he demanded rudely.\n\n\u201cCarraway.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarraway. All right, I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d\n\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that\nthe kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the\nvillage was that the new people weren\u2019t servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\u201cGoing away?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cNo, old sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you fired all your servants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted somebody who wouldn\u2019t gossip. Daisy comes over quite\noften\u2014in the afternoons.\u201d\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They\u2019re all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy\u2019s request\u2014would I come to lunch at her\nhouse tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy\nherself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was\ncoming. Something was up. And yet I couldn\u2019t believe that they would\nchoose this occasion for a scene\u2014especially for the rather harrowing\nscene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only\nthe hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering\nhush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of\ncombustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into\nher white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her\nfingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her\npocketbook slapped to the floor.\n\n\u201cOh, my!\u201d she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm\u2019s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it\u2014but everyone near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\u201cHot!\u201d said the conductor to familiar faces. \u201cSome weather! \u2026 Hot! \u2026\nHot! \u2026 Hot! \u2026 Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it \u2026\u200a?\u201d\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!\n\n\u2026 Through the hall of the Buchanans\u2019 house blew a faint wind, carrying\nthe sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at\nthe door.\n\n\u201cThe master\u2019s body?\u201d roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, madame, but we can\u2019t furnish it\u2014it\u2019s far too hot to touch this\nnoon!\u201d\n\nWhat he really said was: \u201cYes \u2026 Yes \u2026 I\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to\ntake our stiff straw hats.\n\n\u201cMadame expects you in the salon!\u201d he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t move,\u201d they said together.\n\nJordan\u2019s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment\nin mine.\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\u201d I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\u201cThe rumour is,\u201d whispered Jordan, \u201cthat that\u2019s Tom\u2019s girl on the\ntelephone.\u201d\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: \u201cVery\nwell, then, I won\u2019t sell you the car at all \u2026 I\u2019m under no obligations\nto you at all \u2026 and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I\nwon\u2019t stand that at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding down the receiver,\u201d said Daisy cynically.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d I assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s a bona-fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\u201d\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\u201cMr. Gatsby!\u201d He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you, sir \u2026 Nick \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMake us a cold drink,\u201d cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and\npulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\u201cYou know I love you,\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cYou forget there\u2019s a lady present,\u201d said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\u201cYou kiss Nick too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a low, vulgar girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just\nas a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\u201cBles-sed pre-cious,\u201d she crooned, holding out her arms. \u201cCome to your\nown mother that loves you.\u201d\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and\nrooted shyly into her mother\u2019s dress.\n\n\u201cThe bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say\u2014How-de-do.\u201d\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don\u2019t think he\nhad ever really believed in its existence before.\n\n\u201cI got dressed before luncheon,\u201d said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because your mother wanted to show you off.\u201d Her face bent\ninto the single wrinkle of the small white neck. \u201cYou dream, you. You\nabsolute little dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d admitted the child calmly. \u201cAunt Jordan\u2019s got on a white dress\ntoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you like mother\u2019s friends?\u201d Daisy turned her around so that\nshe faced Gatsby. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re pretty?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like her father,\u201d explained Daisy. \u201cShe looks like\nme. She\u2019s got my hair and shape of the face.\u201d\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\u201cCome, Pammy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye, sweetheart!\u201d\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to\nher nurse\u2019s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\u201cThey certainly look cool,\u201d he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n\n\u201cI read somewhere that the sun\u2019s getting hotter every year,\u201d said Tom\ngenially. \u201cIt seems that pretty soon the earth\u2019s going to fall into\nthe sun\u2014or wait a minute\u2014it\u2019s just the opposite\u2014the sun\u2019s getting\ncolder every year.\n\n\u201cCome outside,\u201d he suggested to Gatsby, \u201cI\u2019d like you to have a look\nat the place.\u201d\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in\nthe heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.\nGatsby\u2019s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed\nacross the bay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right across from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are.\u201d\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy\nrefuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat\nmoved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped\nocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sport for you,\u201d said Tom, nodding. \u201cI\u2019d like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\u201d\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and\ndrank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?\u201d cried Daisy, \u201cand the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be morbid,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cLife starts all over again when it\ngets crisp in the fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so hot,\u201d insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \u201cand\neverything\u2019s so confused. Let\u2019s all go to town!\u201d\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding\nits senselessness into forms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,\u201d Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \u201cbut I\u2019m the first man who ever made a stable out of a\ngarage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wants to go to town?\u201d demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby\u2019s eyes\nfloated toward her. \u201cAh,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou look so cool.\u201d\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in\nspace. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\u201cYou always look so cool,\u201d she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and\nthen back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew\na long time ago.\n\n\u201cYou resemble the advertisement of the man,\u201d she went on innocently.\n\u201cYou know the advertisement of the man\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d broke in Tom quickly, \u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on\u2014we\u2019re all going to town.\u201d\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one\nmoved.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d His temper cracked a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, anyhow?\nIf we\u2019re going to town, let\u2019s start.\u201d\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips\nthe last of his glass of ale. Daisy\u2019s voice got us to our feet and out\non to the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\u201cAre we just going to go?\u201d she objected. \u201cLike this? Aren\u2019t we going\nto let anyone smoke a cigarette first?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody smoked all through lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s have fun,\u201d she begged him. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to fuss.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cHave it your own way,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on, Jordan.\u201d\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there\nshuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon\nhovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed\nhis mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\u201cHave you got your stables here?\u201d asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of a mile down the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nA pause.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the idea of going to town,\u201d broke out Tom savagely.\n\u201cWomen get these notions in their heads\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take anything to drink?\u201d called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get some whisky,\u201d answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say anything in his house, old sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got an indiscreet voice,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s full of\u2014\u201d I\nhesitated.\n\n\u201cHer voice is full of money,\u201d he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it.

He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \u201cI ought to have left it in the shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it standard shift?\u201d demanded Tom.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much gas,\u201d he objected.\n\n\u201cPlenty of gas,\u201d said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. \u201cAnd\nif it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a\ndrugstore nowadays.\u201d\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in\nwords, passed over Gatsby\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cCome on, Daisy\u201d said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby\u2019s\ncar. \u201cI\u2019ll take you in this circus wagon.\u201d\n\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\u201cYou take Nick and Jordan. We\u2019ll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\u201d\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan\nand Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby\u2019s car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive\nheat, leaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d demanded Tom.\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known\nall along.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty dumb, don\u2019t you?\u201d he suggested. \u201cPerhaps I am,\nbut I have a\u2014almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to\ndo. Maybe you don\u2019t believe that, but science\u2014\u201d\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back\nfrom the edge of theoretical abyss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a small investigation of this fellow,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\ncould have gone deeper if I\u2019d known\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean you\u2019ve been to a medium?\u201d inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \u201cA medium?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Gatsby.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Gatsby! No, I haven\u2019t. I said I\u2019d been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you found he was an Oxford man,\u201d said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\u201cAn Oxford man!\u201d He was incredulous. \u201cLike hell he is! He wears a pink\nsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless he\u2019s an Oxford man.\u201d\n\n\u201cOxford, New Mexico,\u201d snorted Tom contemptuously, \u201cor something like\nthat.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, Tom. If you\u2019re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\u201d\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\u201cDaisy invited him; she knew him before we were married\u2014God knows\nwhere!\u201d\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we\ndrove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\u2019s faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby\u2019s caution\nabout gasoline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough to get us to town,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a garage right here,\u201d objected Jordan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to\nget stalled in this baking heat.\u201d\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty\nstop under Wilson\u2019s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from\nthe interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some gas!\u201d cried Tom roughly. \u201cWhat do you think we\nstopped for\u2014to admire the view?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d said Wilson without moving. \u201cBeen sick all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all run down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, shall I help myself?\u201d Tom demanded. \u201cYou sounded well enough on\nthe phone.\u201d\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his\nface was green.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I need money\npretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you like this one?\u201d inquired Tom. \u201cI bought it last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice yellow one,\u201d said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\u201cLike to buy it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBig chance,\u201d Wilson smiled faintly. \u201cNo, but I could make some money\non the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want money for, all of a sudden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go\nWest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wife does,\u201d exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been talking about it for ten years.\u201d He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s going whether she\nwants to or not. I\u2019m going to get her away.\u201d\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\u201cI just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\u201d remarked\nWilson. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to get away. That\u2019s why I been bothering\nyou about the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDollar twenty.\u201d\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a\nbad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn\u2019t\nalighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life\napart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically\nsick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel\ndiscovery less than an hour before\u2014and it occurred to me that there\nwas no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as\nthe difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that\nhe looked guilty, unforgivably guilty\u2014as if he had just got some poor\ngirl with child.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you have that car,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI\u2019ll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\u201d\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare\nof afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of\nsomething behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.\nEckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that\nother eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than\ntwenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved\naside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So\nengrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and\none emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a\nslowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar\u2014it\nwas an expression I had often seen on women\u2019s faces, but on Myrtle\nWilson\u2019s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized\nthat her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on\nJordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an\nhour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in\nsight of the easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThose big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\u201d suggested\nJordan. \u201cI love New York on summer afternoons when everyone\u2019s away.\nThere\u2019s something very sensuous about it\u2014overripe, as if all sorts of\nfunny fruits were going to fall into your hands.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201csensuous\u201d had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but\nbefore he could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop, and Daisy\nsignalled us to draw up alongside.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cHow about the movies?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hot,\u201d she complained. \u201cYou go. We\u2019ll ride around and meet you\nafter.\u201d With an effort her wit rose faintly. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you on some\ncorner. I\u2019ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t argue about it here,\u201d Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \u201cYou follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\u201d\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if\nthe traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I\nthink he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his\nlife forever.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in\nthe course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around\nmy legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.\nThe notion originated with Daisy\u2019s suggestion that we hire five\nbathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as\n\u201ca place to have a mint julep.\u201d Each of us said over and over that it\nwas a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d\u2014we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and\nthought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny \u2026\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no\u2019clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery\nfrom the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a swell suite,\u201d whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone\nlaughed.\n\n\u201cOpen another window,\u201d commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d better telephone for an axe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing to do is to forget about the heat,\u201d said Tom impatiently.\n\u201cYou make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\u201d\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the\ntable.\n\n\u201cWhy not let her alone, old sport?\u201d remarked Gatsby. \u201cYou\u2019re the one\nthat wanted to come to town.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its\nnail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, \u201cExcuse\nme\u201d\u2014but this time no one laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick it up,\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \u201cHum!\u201d in\nan interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great expression of yours, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Tom sharply.\n\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this \u2018old sport\u2019 business. Where\u2019d you pick that up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow see here, Tom,\u201d said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \u201cif\nyou\u2019re going to make personal remarks I won\u2019t stay here a minute.\nCall up and order some ice for the mint julep.\u201d\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound\nand we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nWedding March from the ballroom below.\n\n\u201cImagine marrying anybody in this heat!\u201d cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\u201cStill\u2014I was married in the middle of June,\u201d Daisy remembered.\n\u201cLouisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cBiloxi,\u201d he answered shortly.\n\n\u201cA man named Biloxi. \u2018Blocks\u2019 Biloxi, and he made boxes\u2014that\u2019s a\nfact\u2014and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey carried him into my house,\u201d appended Jordan, \u201cbecause we lived\njust two doors from the church.

I knew his whole family history before he\nleft. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.\u201d\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer\nfloated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of\n\u201cYea\u2014ea\u2014ea!\u201d and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting old,\u201d said Daisy. \u201cIf we were young we\u2019d rise and\ndance.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember Biloxi,\u201d Jordan warned her. \u201cWhere\u2019d you know him, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cBiloxi?\u201d He concentrated with an effort. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was not,\u201d she denied. \u201cI\u2019d never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa\nBird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\u201d\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\u201cHe was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\u201d\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\u201cBiloxi?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst place, we didn\u2019t have any president\u2014\u201d\n\nGatsby\u2019s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you\u2019re an Oxford man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014I went there.\u201d\n\nA pause. Then Tom\u2019s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\u201cYou must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\u201d\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice\nbut the silence was unbroken by his \u201cthank you\u201d and the soft closing\nof the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\u201cI told you I went there,\u201d said Gatsby.\n\n\u201cI heard you, but I\u2019d like to know when.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That\u2019s why I\ncan\u2019t really call myself an Oxford man.\u201d\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\u201cIt was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\narmistice,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\u201d\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those\nrenewals of complete faith in him that I\u2019d experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\u201cOpen the whisky, Tom,\u201d she ordered, \u201cand I\u2019ll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won\u2019t seem so stupid to yourself \u2026 Look at the mint!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d snapped Tom, \u201cI want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Gatsby said politely.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\u201d\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t causing a row,\u201d Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \u201cYou\u2019re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-control!\u201d repeated Tom incredulously. \u201cI suppose the latest\nthing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your\nwife. Well, if that\u2019s the idea you can count me out \u2026 Nowadays people\nbegin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next\nthey\u2019ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between\nblack and white.\u201d\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone\non the last barrier of civilization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all white here,\u201d murmured Jordan.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not very popular. I don\u2019t give big parties. I suppose\nyou\u2019ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends\u2014in the modern world.\u201d\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he\nopened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so\ncomplete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something to tell you, old sport\u2014\u201d began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t!\u201d she interrupted helplessly. \u201cPlease let\u2019s all go\nhome. Why don\u2019t we all go home?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I got up. \u201cCome on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wife doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d said Gatsby. \u201cShe\u2019s never loved you.\nShe loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must be crazy!\u201d exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\u201cShe never loved you, do you hear?\u201d he cried. \u201cShe only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a\nterrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!\u201d\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted\nwith competitive firmness that we remain\u2014as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\u201cSit down, Daisy,\u201d Tom\u2019s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on? I want to hear all about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Gatsby. \u201cGoing on for five\nyears\u2014and you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing this fellow for five years?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot seeing,\u201d said Gatsby. \u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn\u2019t know. I used to\nlaugh sometimes\u201d\u2014but there was no laughter in his eyes\u2014\u201cto think that\nyou didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a\nclergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d he exploded. \u201cI can\u2019t speak about what happened five\nyears ago, because I didn\u2019t know Daisy then\u2014and I\u2019ll be damned if I\nsee how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries\nto the back door. But all the rest of that\u2019s a God damned lie. Daisy\nloved me when she married me and she loves me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cShe does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish\nideas in her head and doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing.\u201d He nodded\nsagely. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off\non a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in\nmy heart I love her all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re revolting,\u201d said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \u201cDo\nyou know why we left Chicago? I\u2019m surprised that they didn\u2019t treat you\nto the story of that little spree.\u201d\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\u201cDaisy, that\u2019s all over now,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\nany more. Just tell him the truth\u2014that you never loved him\u2014and it\u2019s\nall wiped out forever.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \u201cWhy\u2014how could I love him\u2014possibly?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never loved him.\u201d\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing\u2014and as though she\nhad never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done\nnow. It was too late.\n\n\u201cI never loved him,\u201d she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\u201cNot at Kapiolani?\u201d demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were\ndrifting up on hot waves of air.\n\n\u201cNot that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your\nshoes dry?\u201d There was a husky tenderness in his tone \u2026 \u201cDaisy?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \u201cThere, Jay,\u201d she said\u2014but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette\nand the burning match on the carpet.\n\n\u201cOh, you want too much!\u201d she cried to Gatsby. \u201cI love you now\u2014isn\u2019t\nthat enough? I can\u2019t help what\u2019s past.\u201d She began to sob\nhelplessly. \u201cI did love him once\u2014but I loved you too.\u201d\n\nGatsby\u2019s eyes opened and closed.\n\n\u201cYou loved me too?\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cEven that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said Tom savagely. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know you were\nalive. Why\u2014there\u2019s things between Daisy and me that you\u2019ll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\u201d\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\u201cI want to speak to Daisy alone,\u201d he insisted. \u201cShe\u2019s all excited\nnow\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEven alone I can\u2019t say I never loved Tom,\u201d she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\u201cAs if it mattered to you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOf course it matters. I\u2019m going to take better care of you from now\non.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \u201cYou\u2019re\nnot going to take care of her any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDaisy\u2019s leaving you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, though,\u201d she said with a visible effort.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not leaving me!\u201d Tom\u2019s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\u201cCertainly not for a common swindler who\u2019d have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand this!\u201d cried Daisy. \u201cOh, please let\u2019s get out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you, anyhow?\u201d broke out Tom. \u201cYou\u2019re one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem\u2014that much I happen to know. I\u2019ve\nmade a little investigation into your affairs\u2014and I\u2019ll carry it\nfurther tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can suit yourself about that, old sport,\u201d said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\u201cI found out what your \u2018drugstores\u2019 were.\u201d He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \u201cHe and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street\ndrugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the\ncounter. That\u2019s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a\nbootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn\u2019t far wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d said Gatsby politely. \u201cI guess your friend Walter\nChase wasn\u2019t too proud to come in on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you left him in the lurch, didn\u2019t you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the\nsubject of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me \u2018old sport\u2019!\u201d cried Tom. Gatsby said\nnothing. \u201cWalter could have you up on the betting laws too, but\nWolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.\u201d\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThat drugstore business was just small change,\u201d continued Tom slowly,\n\u201cbut you\u2019ve got something on now that Walter\u2019s afraid to tell me\nabout.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her\nhusband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but\nabsorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby\u2014and was startled at his expression. He looked\u2014and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden\u2014as if he had\n\u201ckilled a man.\u201d For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying\neverything, defending his name against accusations that had not", "doc_id": "56796092-9cda-491a-876a-c2af7ac15b00", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dc84ca42c4755eea3e447d3117a86b2c48ff51fb5bb885e4b5fa74d6e93e0d77", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 22170, "end": 32968}, "relationships": {"1": "9795e0fc-ff63-47e8-86df-ef3f482f0028", "2": "22406717-46c8-420f-acc0-2076d41e4a40", "3": "1461c245-06ca-444f-88bf-75735089afe3"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1461c245-06ca-444f-88bf-75735089afe3": {"text": "small change,\u201d continued Tom slowly,\n\u201cbut you\u2019ve got something on now that Walter\u2019s afraid to tell me\nabout.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her\nhusband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but\nabsorbing object on the tip of her chin.

But with every word she was drawing further and further into\nherself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the\nafternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,\nstruggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across\nthe room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\u201cPlease, Tom! I can\u2019t stand this any more.\u201d\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\u201cYou two start on home, Daisy,\u201d said Tom. \u201cIn Mr. Gatsby\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous\nscorn.\n\n\u201cGo on. He won\u2019t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\u201d\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,\nisolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhisky in the towel.\n\n\u201cWant any of this stuff? Jordan? \u2026 Nick?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cNick?\u201d He asked again.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWant any?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2026 I just remembered that today\u2019s my birthday.\u201d\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o\u2019clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but\nhis voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on\nthe sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty\u2014the promise of a decade of\nloneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbriefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat\u2019s shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept\nthrough the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the\ngarage, and found George Wilson sick in his office\u2014really sick, pale\nas his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go\nto bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he\u2019d miss a lot of business if\nhe did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent\nracket broke out overhead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my wife locked in up there,\u201d explained Wilson calmly.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we\u2019re\ngoing to move away.\u201d\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.\nGenerally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn\u2019t working, he\nsat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars\nthat passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably\nlaughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife\u2019s man and not\nhis own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn\u2019t say a word\u2014instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he\u2019d been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis\ntook the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he\ndidn\u2019t. He supposed he forgot to, that\u2019s all. When he came outside\nagain, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation\nbecause he heard Mrs. Wilson\u2019s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in\nthe garage.\n\n\u201cBeat me!\u201d he heard her cry. \u201cThrow me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\u201d\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting\u2014before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \u201cdeath car\u201d as the newspapers called it, didn\u2019t stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn\u2019t even sure of\nits colour\u2014he told the first policeman that it was light green. The\nother car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at\nthe corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the\ntremendous vitality she had stored so long.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\u201cWreck!\u201d said Tom. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Wilson\u2019ll have a little business at\nlast.\u201d\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as\nwe came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take a look,\u201d he said doubtfully, \u201cjust a look.\u201d\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \u201cOh, my God!\u201d uttered\nover and over in a gasping moan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some bad trouble here,\u201d said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal\nbasket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a\nviolent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way\nthrough.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\nderanged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson\u2019s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another\nblanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on\na worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\nover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\ndown names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn\u2019t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage\u2014then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\nshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\nfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\nback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\nhorrible call:\n\n\u201cOh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\u201d\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\nthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\nthe policeman.\n\n\u201cM-a-v\u2014\u201d the policeman was saying, \u201c\u2014o\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, r\u2014\u201d corrected the man, \u201cM-a-v-r-o\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me!\u201d muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\u201cr\u2014\u201d said the policeman, \u201co\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cg\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cg\u2014\u201d He looked up as Tom\u2019s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\u201cWhat you want, fella?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u2014that\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuto hit her. Ins\u2019antly killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstantly killed,\u201d repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\u201cShe ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn\u2019t even stopus car.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was two cars,\u201d said Michaelis, \u201cone comin\u2019, one goin\u2019, see?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing where?\u201d asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\u201cOne goin\u2019 each way. Well, she\u201d\u2014his hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped halfway and fell to his side\u2014\u201cshe ran out there an\u2019 the one\ncomin\u2019 from N\u2019York knock right into her, goin\u2019 thirty or forty miles\nan hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of this place here?\u201d demanded the officer.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t got any name.\u201d\n\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n\n\u201cIt was a yellow car,\u201d he said, \u201cbig yellow car. New.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee the accident?\u201d asked the policeman.\n\n\u201cNo, but the car passed me down the road, going faster\u2019n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here and let\u2019s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\u201d\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\nthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\ngrasping cries:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\nof car it was!\u201d\n\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\nfront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pull yourself together,\u201d he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson\u2019s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Tom, shaking him a little. \u201cI just got here a minute\nago, from New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we\u2019ve been talking\nabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn\u2019t mine\u2014do you\nhear? I haven\u2019t seen it all afternoon.\u201d\n\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all that?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend of his.\u201d Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson\u2019s body. \u201cHe says he knows the car that did it \u2026 It was a yellow\ncar.\u201d\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\u201cAnd what colour\u2019s your car?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come straight from New York,\u201d I said.\n\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll let me have that name again correct\u2014\u201d\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\nhim down in a chair, and came back.\n\n\u201cIf somebody\u2019ll come here and sit with him,\u201d he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered: \u201cLet\u2019s get out.\u201d\n\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend\u2014then his foot came down\nhard, and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down\nhis face.\n\n\u201cThe God damned coward!\u201d he whimpered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even stop his car.\u201d\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Buchanans\u2019 house floated suddenly toward us through the dark\nrustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the\nsecond floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\u201cDaisy\u2019s home,\u201d he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\u201cI ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There\u2019s nothing we can\ndo tonight.\u201d\n\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you\u2019re waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the", "doc_id": "1461c245-06ca-444f-88bf-75735089afe3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "aefd5d22573fe6afc7d26126cd96fb487aee430c7dade08fcf17b0ae38d5e70f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 32861, "end": 45134}, "relationships": {"1": "9795e0fc-ff63-47e8-86df-ef3f482f0028", "2": "56796092-9cda-491a-876a-c2af7ac15b00", "3": "737c413f-1c3d-484d-b268-df88122783b9"}, "__type__": "1"}, "737c413f-1c3d-484d-b268-df88122783b9": {"text": "toward us through the dark\nrustling trees.

But I\u2019d be glad if you\u2019d order me the taxi. I\u2019ll wait\noutside.\u201d\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you come in, Nick?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan\nlingered for a moment more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only half-past nine,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d go in; I\u2019d had enough of all of them for one day,\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler\u2019s\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from\nthe house, intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn\u2019t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped\nfrom between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird\nby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity\nof his pink suit under the moon.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cJust standing here, old sport.\u201d\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was\ngoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to\nsee sinister faces, the faces of \u201cWolfshiem\u2019s people,\u201d behind him in\nthe dark shrubbery.\n\n\u201cDid you see any trouble on the road?\u201d he asked after a minute.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\u201cWas she killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\u2019s better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\u201d\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy\u2019s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\u201cI got to West Egg by a side road,\u201d he went on, \u201cand left the car in\nmy garage. I don\u2019t think anybody saw us, but of course I can\u2019t be\nsure.\u201d\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn\u2019t find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\u201cWho was the woman?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cHer name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did\nit happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I tried to swing the wheel\u2014\u201d He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\u201cWas Daisy driving?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cbut of course I\u2019ll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive\u2014and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but\nit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were\nsomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward\nthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second\nmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock\u2014it must have killed her\ninstantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ripped her open\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, old sport.\u201d He winced. \u201cAnyhow\u2014Daisy stepped on it. I\ntried to make her stop, but she couldn\u2019t, so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right tomorrow,\u201d he said presently. \u201cI\u2019m just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She\u2019s locked herself into her room, and if he tries\nany brutality she\u2019s going to turn the light out and on again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t touch her,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s not thinking about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust him, old sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long are you going to wait?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.\u201d\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy\nhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it\u2014he might\nthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright\nwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy\u2019s room on the ground\nfloor.\n\n\u201cYou wait here,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any sign of a\ncommotion.\u201d\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel\nsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains\nwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where\nwe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small\nrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind\nwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren\u2019t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale\u2014and yet they weren\u2019t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said\nthat they were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\u201cIs it all quiet up there?\u201d he asked anxiously.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s all quiet.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019d better come home and get\nsome sleep.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\u201cI want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\u201d\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight\u2014watching over nothing.\n\n\n                                 VIII\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby\u2019s drive,\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress\u2014I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\u201cNothing happened,\u201d he said wanly. \u201cI waited, and about four o\u2019clock\nshe came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned\nout the light.\u201d\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when\nwe hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside\ncurtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of\ndark wall for electric light switches\u2014once I tumbled with a sort of\nsplash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable\namount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they\nhadn\u2019t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar\ntable, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French\nwindows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\u201cYou ought to go away,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty certain they\u2019ll trace\nyour car.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away now, old sport?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t consider it. He couldn\u2019t possibly leave Daisy until he\nknew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and\nI couldn\u2019t bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody\u2014told it to me because \u201cJay Gatsby\u201d had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom\u2019s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \u201cnice\u201d girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with\nindiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from\nCamp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him\u2014he had never been in such a\nbeautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity, was that Daisy lived there\u2014it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already\nin lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year\u2019s\nshining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely\nwithered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved\nDaisy\u2014it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all\nabout the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still\nvibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy\u2019s house by a colossal\naccident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was\nat present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the\ninvisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he\nmade the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously\u2014eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took\nher because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretences. I don\u2019t mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as\nherself\u2014that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact, he had no such facilities\u2014he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t despise himself and it didn\u2019t turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go\u2014but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a\ngrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn\u2019t realize\njust how extraordinary a \u201cnice\u201d girl could be. She vanished into her\nrich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby\u2014nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as\nshe turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She\nhad caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and\nmystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the\nhot struggles of the poor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she\u2019d throw me over, but she\ndidn\u2019t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her \u2026 Well, there I was, way off\nmy ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden\nI didn\u2019t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have\na better time telling her what I was going to do?\u201d\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his\narms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the\nroom and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his\narm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon\nhad made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory\nfor the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer\nin their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with\nanother, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat\u2019s shoulder\nor when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were\nasleep.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he\nwent to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his\nmajority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the\narmistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now\u2014there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy\u2019s letters.

After the\narmistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now\u2014there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy\u2019s letters. She didn\u2019t see\nwhy he couldn\u2019t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world\noutside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her\nand be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\u201cBeale Street Blues\u201d while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately\u2014and the decision\nmust be made by some force\u2014of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality\u2014that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,\ngold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,\nlovely day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she ever loved him.\u201d Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \u201cYou must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her\u2014that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap\nsharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\u201d\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\u201cOf course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married\u2014and loved me more even then, do you see?\u201d\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d he said, \u201cit was just personal.\u201d\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his\nconception of the affair that couldn\u2019t be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their\nwedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to\nLouisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,\nwalking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through\nthe November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy\u2019s house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea\nof the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found\nher\u2014that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach\u2014he was penniless\nnow\u2014was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part\nof it, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\nIt was nine o\u2019clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of\nGatsby\u2019s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves\u2019ll start\nfalling pretty soon, and then there\u2019s always trouble with the pipes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it today,\u201d Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\u201cYou know, old sport, I\u2019ve never used that pool all summer?\u201d\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\u201cTwelve minutes to my train.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to go to the city. I wasn\u2019t worth a decent stroke of\nwork, but it was more than that\u2014I didn\u2019t want to leave Gatsby. I\nmissed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you up,\u201d I said finally.\n\n\u201cDo, old sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you about noon.\u201d\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\u201cI suppose Daisy\u2019ll call too.\u201d He looked at me anxiously, as if he\nhoped I\u2019d corroborate this.\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, goodbye.\u201d\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a rotten crowd,\u201d I shouted across the lawn. \u201cYou\u2019re worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever\ngave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he\nnodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and\nunderstanding smile, as if we\u2019d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact\nall the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of\ncolour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I\nfirst came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and\ndrive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his\ncorruption\u2014and he had stood on those steps, concealing his\nincorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat\u2014I and the others.\n\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d I called. \u201cI enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\u201d\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUp in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me\nup at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between\nhotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other\nway. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,\nas if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the\noffice window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve left Daisy\u2019s house,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m at Hempstead, and I\u2019m going\ndown to Southampton this afternoon.\u201d\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy\u2019s house, but the act\nannoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t so nice to me last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could it have mattered then?\u201d\n\nSilence for a moment. Then:\n\n\u201cHowever\u2014I want to see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see you, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose I don\u2019t go to Southampton, and come into town this\nafternoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t think this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible this afternoon. Various\u2014\u201d\n\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren\u2019t talking\nany longer. I don\u2019t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I\nknow I didn\u2019t care. I couldn\u2019t have talked to her across a tea-table\nthat day if I never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby\u2019s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntimetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there\u2019d be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson\u2019s tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at\nthe garage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have\nbroken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she\nwas stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had\nalready gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she\nimmediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the\naffair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in\nthe wake of her sister\u2019s body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on\nthe couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis\nand several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later\ntwo or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger\nto wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own\nplace and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with\nWilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o\u2019clock the quality of Wilson\u2019s incoherent muttering\nchanged\u2014he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car\nbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his\nwife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose\nswollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \u201cOh,\nmy God!\u201d again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been\nmarried?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwelve years.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver had any children? Come on, George, sit still\u2014I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\u201d\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and\nwhenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it\nsounded to him like the car that hadn\u2019t stopped a few hours before.\nHe didn\u2019t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was\nstained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably\naround the office\u2014he knew every object in it before morning\u2014and from\ntime to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\u201cHave you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven\u2019t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t belong to any.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must\nhave gone to church once. Didn\u2019t you get married in a church? Listen,\nGeorge, listen to me. Didn\u2019t you get married in a church?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking\u2014for a moment\nhe was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came\nback into his faded eyes.\n\n\u201cLook in the drawer there,\u201d he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\u201cWhich drawer?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat drawer\u2014that one.\u201d\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it\nbut a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided\nsilver. It was apparently new.\n\n\u201cThis?\u201d he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\u201cI found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I\nknew it was something funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean your wife bought it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\u201d\n\nMichaelis didn\u2019t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash.

You\u2019d better try and sit\nquiet till morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe murdered her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an accident, George.\u201d\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened\nslightly with the ghost of a superior \u201cHm!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said definitely. \u201cI\u2019m one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon\u2019t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that there\nwas any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had\nbeen running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\u201cHow could she of been like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a deep one,\u201d said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\u201cAh-h-h\u2014\u201d\n\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his\nhand.\n\n\u201cMaybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\u201d\n\nThis was a forlorn hope\u2014he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later\nwhen he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,\nand realized that dawn wasn\u2019t far off. About five o\u2019clock it was blue\nenough outside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson\u2019s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the\nfaint dawn wind.\n\n\u201cI spoke to her,\u201d he muttered, after a long silence. \u201cI told her she\nmight fool me but she couldn\u2019t fool God. I took her to the\nwindow\u201d\u2014with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and\nleaned with his face pressed against it\u2014\u201cand I said \u2018God knows what\nyou\u2019ve been doing, everything you\u2019ve been doing. You may fool me, but\nyou can\u2019t fool God!\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at\nthe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and\nenormous, from the dissolving night.\n\n\u201cGod sees everything,\u201d repeated Wilson.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an advertisement,\u201d Michaelis assured him. Something made him\nturn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson\nstood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding\ninto the twilight.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy six o\u2019clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and\nMichaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and\nhurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements\u2014he was on foot all the time\u2014were afterward traced to\nPort Roosevelt and then to Gad\u2019s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that\nhe didn\u2019t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and\nwalking slowly, for he didn\u2019t reach Gad\u2019s Hill until noon. Thus far\nthere was no difficulty in accounting for his time\u2014there were boys who\nhad seen a man \u201cacting sort of crazy,\u201d and motorists at whom he stared\noddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared\nfrom view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,\nthat he \u201chad a way of finding out,\u201d supposed that he spent that time\ngoing from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On\nthe other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and\nperhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to\nknow. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the\nway to Gatsby\u2019s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby\u2019s name.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt two o\u2019clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the\nbutler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had\namused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to\npump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn\u2019t to be\ntaken out under any circumstances\u2014and this was strange, because the\nfront right fender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep\nand waited for it until four o\u2019clock\u2014until long after there was anyone\nto give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn\u2019t\nbelieve it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was\ntrue he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a\nhigh price for living too long with a single dream. He must have\nlooked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered\nas he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight\nwas upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without\nbeing real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about \u2026 like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur\u2014he was one of Wolfshiem\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2014heard the\nshots\u2014afterwards he could only say that he hadn\u2019t thought anything\nmuch about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby\u2019s house\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that\nalarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a\nword said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried\ndown to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red\ncircle in the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson\u2019s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n                                  IX\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and\nthe next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby\u2019s front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\npool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \u201cmadman\u201d as he bent over Wilson\u2019s body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare\u2014grotesque, circumstantial,\neager, and untrue. When Michaelis\u2019s testimony at the inquest brought\nto light Wilson\u2019s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\nwould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade\u2014but Catherine, who might\nhave said anything, didn\u2019t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\nof character about it too\u2014looked at the coroner with determined eyes\nunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\nseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\nthat her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\nherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\nsuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\nman \u201cderanged by grief\u201d in order that the case might remain in its\nsimplest form. And it rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\non Gatsby\u2019s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the\ncatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\npractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn\u2019t move or breathe or\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\nno one else was interested\u2014interested, I mean, with that intense\npersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\u201cLeft no address?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay when they\u2019d be back?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny idea where they are? How I could reach them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where\nhe lay and reassure him: \u201cI\u2019ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don\u2019t\nworry. Just trust me and I\u2019ll get somebody for you\u2014\u201d\n\nMeyer Wolfshiem\u2019s name wasn\u2019t in the phone book. The butler gave me\nhis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the\nphone.\n\n\u201cWill you ring again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve rung three times.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry. I\u2019m afraid no one\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they\nwere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled\nit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n\n\u201cLook here, old sport, you\u2019ve got to get somebody for me. You\u2019ve got\nto try hard. I can\u2019t go through this alone.\u201d\n\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going\nupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk\u2014he\u2019d\nnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was\nnothing\u2014only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,\nstaring down from the wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure\nhe\u2019d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there\u2019d be a\nwire from Daisy before noon\u2014but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem\narrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and\nnewspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem\u2019s answer I began\nto have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby\nand me against them all.\n\n Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of\n my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a\n mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down\n now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get\n mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little\n later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when\n I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and\n out.\n\n                               Yours truly\n\n                             Meyer Wolfshiem\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man\u2019s voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\u201cThis is Slagle speaking \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\u201cHell of a note, isn\u2019t it? Get my wire?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been any wires.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung Parke\u2019s in trouble,\u201d he said rapidly. \u201cThey picked him up when\nhe handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New\nYork giving \u2019em the numbers just five minutes before. What d\u2019you know\nabout that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d I interrupted breathlessly. \u201cLook here\u2014this isn\u2019t Mr.\nGatsby.

Mr. Gatsby\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation \u2026 then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby\u2019s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on\nthe point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him\nsit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn\u2019t eat, and\nthe glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\u201cI saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all in the\nChicago newspaper. I started right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to reach you.\u201d\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\u201cIt was a madman,\u201d he said. \u201cHe must have been mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like some coffee?\u201d I urged him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I\u2019m all right now, Mr.\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCarraway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\u201d\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him\nthere. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into\nthe hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly\naway.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be\nmixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he\ntook off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d want, Mr. Gatsby\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGatz is my name.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\u201cJimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy\u2019s, Mr.\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were close friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,\nbut he had a lot of brain power here.\u201d\n\nHe touched his head impressively, and I nodded.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019d of lived, he\u2019d of been a great man. A man like James J.\nHill. He\u2019d of helped build up the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the\nbed, and lay down stiffly\u2014was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to\nknow who I was before he would give his name.\n\n\u201cThis is Mr. Carraway,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d He sounded relieved. \u201cThis is Klipspringer.\u201d\n\nI was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at\nGatsby\u2019s grave. I didn\u2019t want it to be in the papers and draw a\nsightseeing crowd, so I\u2019d been calling up a few people myself. They\nwere hard to find.\n\n\u201cThe funeral\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d I said. \u201cThree o\u2019clock, here at the house.\nI wish you\u2019d tell anybody who\u2019d be interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d he broke out hastily. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\u201d\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\u201cOf course you\u2019ll be there yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll certainly try. What I called up about is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cHow about saying you\u2019ll come?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the fact is\u2014the truth of the matter is that I\u2019m staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact, there\u2019s a sort of picnic or something. Of\ncourse I\u2019ll do my best to get away.\u201d\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \u201cHuh!\u201d and he must have heard me, for he\nwent on nervously:\n\n\u201cWhat I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit\u2019d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,\nthey\u2019re tennis shoes, and I\u2019m sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.\u2014\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby\u2014one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby\u2019s liquor, and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfshiem; I couldn\u2019t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked \u201cThe\nSwastika Holding Company,\u201d and at first there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone\ninside. But when I\u2019d shouted \u201chello\u201d several times in vain, an\nargument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess\nappeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile\neyes.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s in,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Wolfshiem\u2019s gone to Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to\nwhistle \u201cThe Rosary,\u201d tunelessly, inside.\n\n\u201cPlease say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get him back from Chicago, can I?\u201d\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem\u2019s, called \u201cStella!\u201d\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\u201cLeave your name on the desk,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I know he\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\u201cYou young men think you can force your way in here any time,\u201d she\nscolded. \u201cWe\u2019re getting sickantired of it. When I say he\u2019s in Chicago,\nhe\u2019s in Chicago.\u201d\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\u201cOh-h!\u201d She looked at me over again. \u201cWill you just\u2014What was your\nname?\u201d\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the\ndoorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking\nin a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered\nme a cigar.\n\n\u201cMy memory goes back to when first I met him,\u201d he said. \u201cA young major\njust out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.\nHe was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he\ncouldn\u2019t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he\ncame into Winebrenner\u2019s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a\njob. He hadn\u2019t eat anything for a couple of days. \u2018Come on have some\nlunch with me,\u2019 I said. He ate more than four dollars\u2019 worth of food\nin half an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you start him in business?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cStart him! I made him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join\nthe American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did\nsome work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything\u201d\u2014he held up two bulbous fingers\u2014\u201calways together.\u201d\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World\u2019s Series\ntransaction in 1919.\n\n\u201cNow he\u2019s dead,\u201d I said after a moment. \u201cYou were his closest friend,\nso I know you\u2019ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, come then.\u201d\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head\nhis eyes filled with tears.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it\u2014I can\u2019t get mixed up in it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to get mixed up in. It\u2019s all over now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any\nway. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different\u2014if a friend\nof mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may\nthink that\u2019s sentimental, but I mean it\u2014to the bitter end.\u201d\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\u201cAre you a college man?\u201d he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \u201cgonnegtion,\u201d but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\u201cLet us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and\nnot after he is dead,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAfter that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\u201d\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West\nEgg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son\u2019s possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\u201cJimmy sent me this picture.\u201d He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \u201cLook there.\u201d\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty\nwith many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \u201cLook\nthere!\u201d and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so\noften that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\u201cJimmy sent it to me. I think it\u2019s a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Had you seen him lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see\nnow there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of\nhim. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\u201d\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another\nminute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and\npulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong\nCassidy.\n\n\u201cLook here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\u201d\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On\nthe last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September\n12, 1906. And underneath:\n\n    Rise from bed                                  6:00      a.m.\n    Dumbell exercise and wall-scaling              6:15-6:30 \u201d\n    Study electricity, etc.                        7:15-8:15 \u201d\n    Work                                           8:30-4:30 p.m.\n    Baseball and sports                            4:30-5:00 \u201d\n    Practise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 \u201d\n    Study needed inventions                        7:00-9:00 \u201d\n\n               General Resolves\n\n  * No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\n\n  * No more smokeing or chewing.\n\n  * Bath every other day\n\n  * Read one improving book or magazine per week\n\n  * Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\n\n  * Be better to parents\n\n\u201cI came across this book by accident,\u201d said the old man. \u201cIt just\nshows you, don\u2019t", "doc_id": "b5a834aa-e102-483e-928c-0ff5a020aa71", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dfb3b142cae9495dbc10fff003e4c73b4c57e36988a72a0ee4c43b10fa821a9b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 83645, "end": 94778}, "relationships": {"1": "9795e0fc-ff63-47e8-86df-ef3f482f0028", "2": "10c27494-f9b5-4852-9804-f012dc6ab442", "3": "a7219167-33b4-4dff-baf6-0aed95d60f1a"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7219167-33b4-4dff-baf6-0aed95d60f1a": {"text": "   Practise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 \u201d\n    Study needed inventions                        7:00-9:00 \u201d\n\n               General Resolves\n\n  * No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\n\n  * No more smokeing or chewing.\n\n  * Bath every other day\n\n  * Read one improving book or magazine per week\n\n  * Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\n\n  * Be better to parents\n\n\u201cI came across this book by accident,\u201d said the old man. \u201cIt just\nshows you, don\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just shows you.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this\nor something. Do you notice what he\u2019s got about improving his mind? He\nwas always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat\nhim for it.\u201d\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby\u2019s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn\u2019t any use. Nobody came.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout five o\u2019clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate\u2014first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the\nlimousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg, in Gatsby\u2019s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I\nlooked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby\u2019s books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI\u2019d never seen him since then. I don\u2019t know how he knew about the\nfuneral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby\u2019s grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already\ntoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that\nDaisy hadn\u2019t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\u201cBlessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\u201d and then the owl-eyed\nman said \u201cAmen to that,\u201d in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get to the house,\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cNeither could anybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on!\u201d He started. \u201cWhy, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\u201d\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n\n\u201cThe poor son-of-a-bitch,\u201d he said.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o\u2019clock of a\nDecember evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That\u2019s and the\nchatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught\nsight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: \u201cAre you\ngoing to the Ordways\u2019? the Herseys\u2019? the Schultzes\u2019?\u201d and the long\ngreen tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky\nyellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking\ncheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and\nthe dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild\nbrace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we\nwalked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware\nof our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we\nmelted indistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat\u2019s my Middle West\u2014not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family\u2019s name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all\u2014Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old\u2014even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse\u2014the wrong house. But no one knows the woman\u2019s name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby\u2019s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes\u2019 power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together, and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like\na good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the\ncolour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without\ncomment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though\nthere were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I\npretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn\u2019t\nmaking a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up\nto say goodbye.\n\n\u201cNevertheless you did throw me over,\u201d said Jordan suddenly. \u201cYou threw\nme over on the telephone. I don\u2019t give a damn about you now, but it\nwas a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\u201d\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\u201cOh, and do you remember\u201d\u2014she added\u2014\u201ca conversation we had once about\ndriving a car?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014not exactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn\u2019t I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thirty,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m five years too old to lie to myself and\ncall it honour.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as\nI slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,\nholding out his hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. You know what I think of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Nick,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cCrazy as hell. I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s the matter with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d I inquired, \u201cwhat did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\u201d\n\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after\nme and grabbed my arm.\n\n\u201cI told him the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren\u2019t in\nhe tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if\nI hadn\u2019t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house\u2014\u201d He broke off defiantly.\n\u201cWhat if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy\u2019s, but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you\u2019d run over a dog and never even\nstopped his car.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it\nwasn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cAnd if you think I didn\u2019t have my share of suffering\u2014look here, when\nI went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits\nsitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By\nGod it was awful\u2014\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done\nwas, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and\nconfused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy\u2014they smashed up\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their\nvast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let\nother people clean up the mess they had made \u2026\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery\nstore to buy a pearl necklace\u2014or perhaps only a pair of cuff\nbuttons\u2014rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGatsby\u2019s house was still empty when I left\u2014the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn\u2019t want to hear it and I avoided him when\nI got off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,\ndazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still\nhear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a\nmaterial car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I\ndidn\u2019t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away\nat the ends of the earth and didn\u2019t know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the\nSound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to\nmelt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that\nflowered once for Dutch sailors\u2019 eyes\u2014a fresh, green breast of the new\nworld. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\u2019s\nhouse, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all\nhuman dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his\nbreath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic\ncontemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the\nlast time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for\nwonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby\u2019s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy\u2019s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream\nmust have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He\ndid not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic\nrolled on under the night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no\nmatter\u2014tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further \u2026 And\none fine morning\u2014\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.", "doc_id": "a7219167-33b4-4dff-baf6-0aed95d60f1a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ba0500dbcc35e7b8db77b279535896d5f921ab32de869ca3f86e05a38bbda3c3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 94735, "end": 107905}, "relationships": {"1": "9795e0fc-ff63-47e8-86df-ef3f482f0028", "2": "b5a834aa-e102-483e-928c-0ff5a020aa71"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "ref_doc_info": {"9795e0fc-ff63-47e8-86df-ef3f482f0028": {"doc_hash": "101e3a1595165eb3abe26d3946149ea1fc08320cb8c75ea2872a404cd81efaf7"}, "3e92e95f-77c4-440f-b6bc-0ae0087ebfc5": {"doc_hash": "1d94bd4038cd5ce16e75ddccf007517e311557024903363a9e9ba674c67ba77f"}, "22406717-46c8-420f-acc0-2076d41e4a40": {"doc_hash": "4ebb6a469ab0fe8b6fd139cead9e495027044a7b0a18584fc871229b46ffc736"}, "56796092-9cda-491a-876a-c2af7ac15b00": {"doc_hash": "dc84ca42c4755eea3e447d3117a86b2c48ff51fb5bb885e4b5fa74d6e93e0d77"}, "1461c245-06ca-444f-88bf-75735089afe3": {"doc_hash": "aefd5d22573fe6afc7d26126cd96fb487aee430c7dade08fcf17b0ae38d5e70f"}, "737c413f-1c3d-484d-b268-df88122783b9": {"doc_hash": "96baa938f1f4d6203308b426e966f7feb0496ce007dcbd75b6e9e562ae25aaa4"}, "38374827-4d74-483f-94c1-83a44ff4446a": {"doc_hash": "a4990077b7d44ad64d0e538758d6b521a571fc156568a5e915110c4e6baff0e2"}, "10c27494-f9b5-4852-9804-f012dc6ab442": {"doc_hash": "a6d05ac29af9b4368a96e3119c3a83bd7c95436f3a0c4f147315f430980aa9d8"}, "b5a834aa-e102-483e-928c-0ff5a020aa71": {"doc_hash": "dfb3b142cae9495dbc10fff003e4c73b4c57e36988a72a0ee4c43b10fa821a9b"}, "a7219167-33b4-4dff-baf6-0aed95d60f1a": {"doc_hash": "ba0500dbcc35e7b8db77b279535896d5f921ab32de869ca3f86e05a38bbda3c3"}}}}}
